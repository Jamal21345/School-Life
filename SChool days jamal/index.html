    <p>My name is Jamal Bailey. I'm 15 years old. My house is in the northeast<br>
      section of Bang Bon, where all the villas are, and I am not married.<br>
      I study at Sarasas Witaed Bangbon, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.<br>
       I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep,<br>
        no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed,<br>
        I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.<br>
        I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.<br>
        I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.<br>
         That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
